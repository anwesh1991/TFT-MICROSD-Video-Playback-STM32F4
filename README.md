Display a bitmap image on a TFT-LCD screen using STM32 Nucleo F446RE microcontroller and libopencm3 library.
Tested only with the Nucleo F446RE microcontroller, but should work with other STM32F4 Nucleo boards too. For F1/F2/F3 boards, modifications might be needed. 
The libopencm3 folder in this repository is a heavily trimmed version of the original containing the required files needed to compile code only for the STM32F4 platform. 

Run the buildflashscript.sh script in the root folder to quickly flash the image and the source code to your Nucelo board.

Description, images, pin-mappings, scripts, To-Do list etc to be updated.
